<h1>About Kevin Du</h1>
<p>I was born in Iowa City and grew up in Irvine, California with my mom, dad, and a younger brother. Ever since I remember, I’ve been a fan of math. From creating math games to play with my friends on the cruise to deriving Euler’s identity on napkins while waiting at a restaurant, I was always able to find something interesting to do with math.

I distinctly remember a time in fourth grade when my parents were exploring new houses for sale. As they inspected every corner of the house, I naturally got bored and wandered off on my own. We were getting ready to leave when I spotted a half-sheet of paper on a table, on which were written the formula for the sums of squares and cubes of the first n positive integers. That sheet of paper changed my leisure time plans for the next few nights. I remember feeling extremely accomplished after deriving all those formulas up to the seventh degree. By the eleventh formula, I realized that all of this was online and people found these results centuries ago, so what I just learned through my own exploration connected me to mathematicians in the past. People change. Math doesn't.

Math isn’t about finding the right answer. It’s about exploring the unknown.

Math has always been the most fascinating subject to me since I was young. One of my favorite things to do is creating math problems and puzzles for my peers to solve. Along with a group of friends, I started to expand the program among young students to help them realize that math is not only important, but also fun. Math is a beautiful subject, and the sooner kids understand this the better. I would like to help students build their love and confidence in math in their schoolwork and beyond.

<p>
Leading an organization this big takes a lot of energy, but seeing the positive learning results from many of our students makes it rewarding and exciting to me. I am very thankful to have a team of engaged leaders and tutors to share the same passion of teaching with me to pursue our mission.

<p>
For me, teaching in this program has always been incredibly enjoyable. My three years of teaching experience have taught me how to actively engage students and assessed me on how well I can explain the most basic math principles. As Einstein said, <b>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." </b>
