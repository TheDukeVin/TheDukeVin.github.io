<h1>Math Matters</h1>
<p>Even as a student who loved math, I understood that math isn’t always taught in an engaging way in schools; so, in eighth grade, I started teaching math at a local library for one simple reason - to help young students realize that math is not only important, but also fun. Math is a beautiful subject, and the sooner kids understand this the better.

After seeing the demand for math help from so many young students, I started to recruit and train more tutors to provide help to more students in need. We eventually expanded our program to six libraries in Orange County. During the outbreak of COVID-19, we moved our tutoring sessions online, which enabled us to help even more students. We now see tutors and students from LA, San Diego, riverside and even outside California in Texas, New York, Colorado, Ohio, and many more states.
</p>
<p>
Leading an organization this big takes a lot of energy, but seeing the positive learning results from many of our students makes it rewarding and exciting to me. I am very thankful to have a team of engaged leaders and tutors to share the same passion of teaching with me to pursue our mission.
</p>
<p>
For me, teaching in this program has always been incredibly enjoyable. My three years of teaching experience have taught me how to actively engage students and assessed me on how well I can explain the most basic math principles. As Einstein said, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
