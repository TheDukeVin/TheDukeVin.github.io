<h1> Kevin Du's Personal Site </h1>

<p>
I am basically a math nerd who likes creating challenging puzzle games. You can find some of them on my site (of course I have plenty of others, but they didn't deserve the time for me to convert them to javascript and put them on this site).
</p>

<h2> Stuff that I do </h2>

<p>
I tutor math at a program called Math Matters. I am the co-founder and president. Read more about it at the program website: <a href="https://www.mathmatters4all.org/home"> Math Matters </a>
</p>

<p>
I play saxophone and I perform at various gigs with my band Golden Wind. Check it out at <a href="http://goldenwindsax.com/"> Golden Wind </a>
