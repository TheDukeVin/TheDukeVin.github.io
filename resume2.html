Math has always been the most fascinating subject to me since I was young. One of my favorite things to do is creating math problems and puzzles for my peers to solve. Along with a group of friends, I started to expand the program among young students to help them realize that math is not only important, but also fun. Math is a beautiful subject, and the sooner kids understand this the better. I would like to help students build their love and confidence in math in their schoolwork and beyond.

<p>
Leading an organization this big takes a lot of energy, but seeing the positive learning results from many of our students makes it rewarding and exciting to me. I am very thankful to have a team of engaged leaders and tutors to share the same passion of teaching with me to pursue our mission.

For me, teaching in this program has always been incredibly enjoyable. My three years of teaching experience have taught me how to actively engage students and assessed me on how well I can explain the most basic math principles. As Einstein said, <b>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." </b>
