<h1>Fun Coding Projects</h1>
<p>I started getting into coding in seventh grade and I got hooked immediately. I’d come home everyday and spend hours coding games and mathematical systems.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I started to make serious coding projects and I wanted some way to display them for my friends to play. And that’s what started my github website. I asked my friends what they thought of my game, and some said they were “IQ tests”, which was fair. 
</p>
<p>
Check out some of my puzzle games here.
